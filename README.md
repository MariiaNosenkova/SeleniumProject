 I have prepared 3 test scenarios for training website https://demo.guru99.com/payment-gateway/purchasetoy.php
 I have created 3 test scenarios with 2 test cases for each. Test scenarios and test cases with steps you can check below on this page. While testing basic internet shop, I have come up with idea to test the following parts of purchasing: 1) buy 2 and 4 items and confirm that amount of payment is being changed accordingly; 2) check payments with two different types of cards (VISA and MasterCard) and confirm that payment is done successfully; 3) get automatically generated card number and check the payment balance; get automatically generated card number with credit limit 100 usd, pay using this card, check the balance after transaction. 
For all test scenarios I have chosen Selenium as a main tool for writing automated test cases. All test cases and changes in code are being downloaded to my github repository.  
Test scenarios, test cases and steps of each test you can check below.
